# JS DOM Table of Contents

## Set Up

1. Fork this repo and clone it down to your `sei/homework` folder.
2. Navigate into the directory and open the `index.html` file with Live Server in your browser window.
3. Follow the directions below. When finished, submit your work via a pull request.
4. Unless otherwise specified, homework is due the next day at 10:00 AM EST.

## Instructions

You will see that your `index.html` file contains a LOT of text, with `h1`, `h2`, and `p` tags.

Your goal is to use JavaScript only to create a Table of Contents!

Get every h1 or h2 from the html file and create a list item inside of the `aside` element for every title.

All your HTML for the Table of Contents in the `aside` element must be generated (created) with JavaScript! I.e., do not hard-code the heading titles inside your HTML file.

<details>
<summary>Need a hint?</summary>

1. First use a DOM method to retrieve "get" the h1/h2 elements from the DOM by their class name.
2. Then think about what JS DOM method you might use to add those headers to the `aside` element.
3. Remember that your Table of Contents should be created from DOM methods inside your `script.js` file, and that you should not directly edit your `index.html` file.
